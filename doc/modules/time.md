## time â€” Time access

This module contains time-related functions.

### Attribute

* `time.altzone` : The offset of the local DST timezone, in second, west of UTC.
* `time.daylight` : Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined.
* `time.timezone` : The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds, west of UTC (negative in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in the UK).
* `time.tzname` : A tuple of two strings: the first is the name of the local non-DST timezone, the second is the name of the local DST timezone.

### Functions

* `time.asctime([t])` : Converts a tuple or *struct_time* representing a time as returned by `gmtime()` or `localtime()` to a 24-character string of the following form: 'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'. If *t* is not provided, the current time as returned by `localtime()` is used.
* `time.clock()` : Returns the current processor time as a floating point number expressed in seconds.
* `time.ctime([secs])` : Converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time.  If *secs* is not provided or *None*, the current time as returned by `time()` is used.
* `time.gmtime([secs])` : Converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a *struct_time* in UTC in which the dst flag is always zero. If *secs* is not provided or *None*, the current time as returned by `time()` is used.
* `time.localtime([secs])` : Like `gmtime()` but converts to local time. If `secs` is not provided or *None*, the current time as returned by `time()` is used.
* `time.mktime(t)` : This is the inverse function of `localtime()`. Its argument is the *struct_time* or a full 9-tuple.
* `time.sleep(secs)` : Suspends execution of the current thread for the given number of seconds.
* `time.time()`: Returns the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number.

### Class

* `time.struct_time`: The type of the time value sequence returned by `gmtime()` and `localtime()`.

### Example

```python
import time

print(time.timezone)
print(time.altzone)
print(time.ctime())
print(time.clock())
print(time.localtime())
print(time.gmtime())
print(time.tzname)

# print out time every 1 second
for i in range(10):
    print(time.asctime())
    time.sleep(1)
```
