## SQLite â€” Small + Fast SQL Database Engine

SQLite is an SQL database engine that is built into most devices that exist today. Python comes with an SQLite library built in. This library allows you to store data between each time your program is run as well as search through it with queries.

Using SQLite will require the use of **Structured Query Language** to interface with the database. SQL statements can become very complex quickly, but we will go over some basic commands for creating a table, then adding, reading, and deleting rows of data from it.

##### Quick Note About SQL Statements

SQL statements are case-insensitive, so the following two statements are the same:

```SQL
SELECT last_name, first_name, age FROM students WHERE age>15;
```

```SQL
select last_name, first_name, age from students where age>15;
```

Usually key words like **SELECT**, **FROM**, **WHERE**, and so on are capitalized to differntiate them from the custom database table and column names.

### Example: Simple Student Roster

#### Creating a Database and Initializing a Table

Before we store any data, we need to create a **table**. SQL databases are set up similarly to a spreadsheet, where each entry is a **row** with data that lines up with named **columns**.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

create_table_sql_str = '''
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    last_name TEXT,
    first_name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    gpa REAL
);
'''
conn.execute(create_table_sql_str)
print('Table created successfully')

conn.close()
```

This will create a file named "example.db" in your project's root folder, and it will create a table that is set up like this:

```sql
id | last_name | first_name | age | gpa
---------------------------------------
```

The "id" field we set up is special as it is the **INTEGER PRIMARY KEY**. This field will automatically increment each time we insert a row into this table.

#### Inserting Data Into the Table

Now that we have a table, let's write another statement to insert some data into it:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
insert_sql_str = '''
INSERT INTO students (last_name, first_name, age, gpa)
VALUES
    ('Doe', 'John', 16, 3.2),
    ('Doe', 'Jane', 13, 3.8),
    ('Smith', 'Ronald', 14, 2.7),
    ('Aster', 'Jean', 11, 3.4);
'''
conn.execute(insert_sql_str)
conn.commit()  # this line actually finalizes the operation and saves to disk
conn.close()
```

After running this code, your table will now have the following data:

```sql
id | last_name | first_name | age | gpa
---------------------------------------
 1 |    Doe    |    John    | 16  | 3.2
 2 |    Doe    |    Jane    | 13  | 3.8
 3 |   Smith   |   Ronald   | 14  | 2.7
 4 |   Aster   |    Jean    | 11  | 3.4

```

Note how we didn't specify an id, and it was automatically added for us.

#### Searching For Specific Students

And now that our table has data from it, we want a specific set of data. Let's run the first example query used at the beginning of this guide:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
query_sql_str = '''
SELECT last_name, first_name, age FROM students WHERE age>15;
'''
cursor = conn.execute(query_sql_str)
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

Output:

```text
('Doe', 'John', 16)
```

#### Ordering Query Results

By default, there is no guarantee any data returned by a query will be in any specific order. Most of the time this is ok, but if we need data returned in any specific order, we can do this with the **ORDER BY** keyphrase:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
query_sql_str = '''
SELECT * FROM students WHERE gpa>=3 ORDER BY last_name;
'''
cursor = conn.execute(query_sql_str)
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

Output:

```text
(4, 'Aster', 'Jean', 11, 3.4)
(1, 'Doe', 'John', 16, 3.2)
(2, 'Doe', 'Jane', 13, 3.8)
```

Notice how it returned the entire row for each student. That's because we used the **\*** character, which selects all existing columns in order without having to write them out individually.

#### Update an Existing Row

Sometimes you need to edit a row that is already inserted into the table. You can do this with an update query. Keep in mind that you cannot undo an update after it is committed:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
update_sql_str = '''
UPDATE students SET gpa=3.9 WHERE id=3;
'''
conn.execute(update_sql_str)
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

After running this code, the student with `id=3` will have their GPA updated:

```sql
id | last_name | first_name | age | gpa
---------------------------------------
 3 |   Smith   |   Ronald   | 14  | 3.9
```

#### Delete Data from a Table

Final of the main four operations, we can delete a row of data that is no longer needed. Keep in mind that like updates, you cannot undo a delete once it is committed:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
delete_sql_str = '''
DELETE FROM students WHERE age=16;
'''
conn.execute(delete_sql_str)
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

Our final table looks like this, note how the id column **did not** get automatically updated:

```sql
id | last_name | first_name | age | gpa
---------------------------------------
 2 |    Doe    |    Jane    | 13  | 3.8
 3 |   Smith   |   Ronald   | 14  | 2.7
 4 |   Aster   |    Jean    | 11  | 3.4
```

We only had one student with an `age=16` in our table, but the above query would have deleted **all** students with `age=16`. The next student inserted into this table will have an id of 5.
