# Standard Python Libraries

 The OYOclass Python3 Editor is based on Python 3.6, so technically you can use any of the standard Python3.6 libraries in the editor, except the `Turtle` and `tkinter` graphic libraries.

 Here we list some libraries as examples, for more you could find all libraries in [Python's official documents.](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/)


 * [math library](math.md)
 * [random library](random.md)
 * [string library](string.md)
